Practice Test System: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike other online test offered by current 11+ websites, the proposed test system will include 
a) Detailed explaination of related Concept
b) Valuation with respect to other participants
c) Interactive 
d) Option of turning off timer ?
e) Detailed Test Report
f) Action Items 
9) Comparison with previous test 

a) As each question is "linked" to its Topic or concept, we can provide explaination why the 
correct option is correct and incorrect options are incorrect. Some study materials can also be 
referred. 

b) For each question, it informs the student how much % have correctly answered this question. 
It helps the parent to evaluate the competency level of student related with other students. Either 
he/she is among Top 10% or Top 20% in that Topic.

c) Interactive question means, with each correct or incorrect answer, the "level" of competency of 
next question be either higher or lower. First question will be of mid "level", the next question 
will move in either direction.

d) Practice test can be either Timer based. User may also have option to pause the timer at any time.

e) Instead of just giving a test score, the Test report would provide evaluation per each Topic. It 
classify student either "competent", "moderate" or "need improvement" per Topic.

f) This is the most important step as it suggest parents what are Top 3 areas to focus. It simulates 
that if the student would have done better in these areas, the overall score would jump from current 
score of 73% to 79%. It generates a bell shape curve using student score with respect to other 
sample scores. 

g) Comparison report with previous test scores. Graph that keep track of students scores over time 
and we can use apply Bayesian probability to "predict" likelihood of student making it to Grammar 
school. Provided that we accumulate enough data in 1-2 years.
